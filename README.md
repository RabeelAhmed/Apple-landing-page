Apple 3D Landing Page
This project is a 3D landing page for Apple products, created as part of a learning journey in 3D web development. The page features a 3D model of a MacBook Pro, interactive scrolling effects, and a design inspired by Apple's aesthetics. It was built using React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, Tailwind CSS, and WebGPU.


Learning Journey
This project was developed as part of my ongoing efforts to learn new technologies and enhance my skills in React and 3D web development. The idea was to explore how to integrate Three.js with React using React Three Fiber, and how to create a responsive, visually appealing 3D landing page. The process was both challenging and rewarding, offering valuable insights into modern web development practices.


Features
3D rendering of a MacBook Pro using Three.js
Smooth scrolling and animations with React Three Fiber and @react-three/drei
Environment map for realistic reflections
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Interactive navbar with links
Stylish typography and layout inspired by Apple
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Three.js: For rendering 3D graphics.
React Three Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js.
@react-three/drei: Utilities and helpers for working with React Three Fiber.
WebGPU: For high-performance 3D graphics in the browser.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.

Credits
This project was inspired and guided by the tutorials and teachings of Harsh Vardan Sharma at Sheryians Coding School. His courses provided a solid foundation in React and 3D web development, helping me bring this project to life.
